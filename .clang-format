# This is a .clang-format configuration file used to define coding style rules for C++ projects.
#
# - BasedOnStyle: Specifies the base style to use as a starting point. Here, 'LLVM' is used.
# - IndentWidth: Sets the number of spaces for each indentation level (4 spaces in this case).
# - TabWidth: Defines the width of a tab character (4 spaces here).
# - UseTab: Determines whether to use tabs for indentation. 'Never' means spaces are always used.
# - BreakBeforeBraces: Configures the placement of braces. 'Allman' style places braces on a new line.
# - AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: Allows short functions to be written on a single line if they are empty.
# - ColumnLimit: Sets the maximum line length (120 characters here).
# - PointerAlignment: Specifies the alignment of pointer symbols. 'Left' aligns pointers with the type.
# - SpacesInParentheses: Controls whether spaces are added inside parentheses. 'false' disables this.
# - SpaceAfterCStyleCast: Adds a space after C-style casts if set to true.
# - Cpp11BracedListStyle: Enforces consistent formatting for C++11 braced initializer lists.
# - IncludeBlocks: Determines how include directives are grouped. 'Preserve' keeps the original grouping.
# - SortIncludes: Enables sorting of include directives alphabetically.
# - IndentCaseLabels: Ensures case labels in switch statements are indented.
# - AlignConsecutiveAssignments: Aligns consecutive assignment statements for better readability.
# - AlignConsecutiveDeclarations: Aligns consecutive declarations for better readability.
# - ReflowComments: Reformats comments to fit within the specified column limit.
